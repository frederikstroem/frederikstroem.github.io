[Go to the website for SDU Exam Monitor Linux Install Helper](https://frederikstroem.com/SDU-Exam-Monitor-Linux-Install-Helper/)

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm not in any way afflitiated with [Exam Monitor](https://sdu.exammonitor.dk/)!

## Motivation
I'm a student at The University of Southern Denmark (SDU), and I wanted Exam Monitor to be easier to launch on Linux. There are a lot of things I do NOT like about Exam Monitor, but the install process was one thing I could fix...

By launching the program from a terminal, its outputs are also easier to monitor (expect a ton of warnings though, it is Java after all üòù).
