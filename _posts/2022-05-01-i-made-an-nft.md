title: I made an NFT

This weekend I made NFT's ([non-fungible tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)) with a friend, saved the images to a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/frederikstroem/NFTs), and minted the NFT's to the [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/) blockchain.

This was done because it was easy, cheap and fun to do on Avalanche. Quite silly, but I think the concept of NFT's could be an interesting replacement to traditional ticketing systems for festivals, concerts etc. I am not overly convinced of the whole digital arts thing yet, but I guess time will tell. ðŸ˜…

I made a dedicated page for this small project at [https://frederikstroem.com/NFTs/](https://frederikstroem.com/NFTs/).

**EDIT 2022-08-02:** NFT's and metadata moved to [https://frederikstroem.com/nft-collection](https://frederikstroem.com/nft-collection).
