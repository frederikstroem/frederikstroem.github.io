[I set up frederikstroem.com as my "web3 username"](https://app.ens.domains/name/frederikstroem.com/details).

It's an interesting idea, I guess time will tell if I'm ever to use it... But I kinda like the idea, decentralization! ðŸš€

P.S. [this guide](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/step-by-step-guide-of-how-to-claim-your-dns-domain-on-ens-60a2d2dcbe6e) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220731000742/https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/step-by-step-guide-of-how-to-claim-your-dns-domain-on-ens-60a2d2dcbe6e)) is quite nice if you're setting up your .com domain that was bought from Namecheap. ðŸ˜‰
