            Hi there, ðŸ‘‹
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Frederik Holm StrÃ¸m, and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at The University of Southern Denmark. I'm also working at B&R Industrial Automation GmbH <i>(business unit of the ABB Group)</i> as a Student Programmer.

        <p>
            I find joy in participating in the expansion of global collective intelligence. Or said in other words, I enjoy to keep learning and building new cool stuff everyday, and I want to share this with my fellow humans! I believe we have to be nice to each other as well as the animals roaming beside us, taking care of this planet whilst doing so.<br>
            I'm therefore also very passionate about protecting individual freedoms and the basic rights of all human beings, as well as preserving the wonderful nature of the world we live in.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a Linux user, and I enjoy being in control of my data. I therefore use a lot of open-source software and do some self-hosting when it makes sense. This "control your data" mindset has also manifested itself in my interest for cryptography as well as cryptocurrencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm generally interested in tech and science, but my main focus are in software development. I also have a strong interest in high quality products and doing things right.
        </p>
