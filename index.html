                    <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm very interested in software development and the agile workflow it enables. My primary programming language of choice is Rust.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Linux & FOSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a long time Linux user and I enjoy free and open source software, including the community around it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Embedded Systems & Electronics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy tinkering with electronics and I also find the interconnection between software and hardware quite fascinating.

                    <h3>Automation & AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been quite inspired by the great leaps in artificial intelligence, and how these tools can be applied to solve problems in a wide variety of domains. I'm also a bit obsessed with getting things done, hence my interest in automation, these two fields are luckily also meaningfully intertwined.

                    <h3>Taking Care</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I would like to mention that I care deeply about the environment, the well-being of humans, animals and the planet as a whole. I'm therefore also very interested in green technology, as well as promoting sustainable development. I also strongly belive in human rights and democratic values.
