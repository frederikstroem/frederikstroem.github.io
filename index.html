                    <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm very interested in software development and the agile workflow it enables. My primary programming language of choice is Rust, and it's the tool I use for most software solutions. I also enjoy working with Python, as well as TypeScript and web technologies.

                    <h3>Linux & FOSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm a long time Linux user and I also enjoy free and open source software, including the community around it. This in part, is due to the transparency FOSS provides, but also democratizing information which I view important as part of growing the collective intelligence of humanity.

                    <h3>InfoSec & Cybersecurity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Understanding how to keep the systems I'm working on secure and available is something I prioritize dearly. I have for years been following the developing threat landscape, as well as defensive strategies that is deployed by the industry.

                    <h3>Embedded Systems & Electronics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy tinkering with electronics and I also find the interconnection between software and hardware quite fascinating. As a side note, I also find it a little funny that my last name <i>"StrÃ¸m"</i> means <i>"current"</i> in Danish, given my interest in EVs and electronics.

                    <h3>Automation & AI</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've been quite inspired by the great leaps in artificial intelligence, and how these tools can be applied to solve problems in a wide variety of domains. There is a meaningful interconnection from AI to automation, which is a field I also enjoy, especially because it aids in productivity which is something I strive for.

                    <h3>Taking Care</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I would like to mention that I care deeply about the environment, the well-being of humans, animals and the planet as a whole. I'm therefore also very interested in green technology, as well as promoting sustainable development. I also strongly belive in human rights and democratic values.
